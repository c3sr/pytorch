description: >
    This model is a replication of the model described in the Resnet publication originally written in Caffe.
    The pre-trained model expects input in mini-batches of 3-channel BGR images of shape (3 x H x W), where H and W are expected to be 224. The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 255] and then normalized using mean = [102.9801, 115.9465, 122.7717] and std = [1, 1, 1]
