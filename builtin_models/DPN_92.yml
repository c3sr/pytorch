description: >
    This model is a replication of the model described in the Dual Path Networks publication.
    The pre-trained model expects input in mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (3 x H x W), where H and W are expected to be 224. The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [0.48627450980392156, 0.4588235294117647, 0.40784313725490196] and std = [0.23482446870963955, 0.23482446870963955, 0.23482446870963955]
