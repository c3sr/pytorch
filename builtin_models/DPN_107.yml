description: >
    This model is a replication of the model described in the Dual Path Networks publication.
    The pre-trained model expects input in mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (3 x H x W), where H and W are expected to be 224. The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [124 / 255, 117 / 255, 104 / 255] and std = [1 / (.0167 * 255), 1 / (.0167 * 255), 1 / (.0167 * 255)]
